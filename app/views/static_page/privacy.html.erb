      <h4>International Transfer</h4>
      <p>
      YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO - AND MAINTAINED ON - COMPUTERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF YOUR STATE, PROVINCE, COUNTRY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL JURISDICTION WHERE THE PRIVACY LAWS MAY NOT BE AS PROTECTIVE AS THOSE IN YOUR JURISDICTION.

      </p>
      <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
      <p class="about-content">Our primary goal in collecting information is to facilitate the search functionality of our Site in order to connect users with relevant events and performances in their city. The listing information a Venue provides about their event will be used solely to allow users to browse tickets that meet their interests. We will not use such information for any other purposes such as tracking your location. We will not sell that information, or any other personally identifiable information, to third-parties. Potential advertisers or sponsors on our site will only be able to create targeted advertising based on non-identifiable demographic information. We may send you promotional material in the form of a newsletter to the email address you provided upon registration. You will have the option to unsubscribe.</p>
      <h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
      <p class="about-content">When you register with us and become a User, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Identity Information"). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, university email address, class year, gender, and home postal address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. No other information will be required upon registration. Optional information includes your cell phone number, Facebook and LinkedIn profile link, gender, and date of birth. </p>
      <h4>Payment Processing</h4>
      <p class="about-content">Upon check-out, you will be asked to enter your billing and address information. This information will be used solely for the purpose of charging your form of payment and delivering your tickets. The venue will be able to see this information. We will not disclose or sell this information, or use it for any purpose other than to facilitate the transaction.</p>
      <p class="about-content">We do not collect or store credit card information. All credit and account numbers are transmitted directly through our payment processor. They are not stored or transmitted through or on our servers.</p>
      <p>WE WILL NOT USE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO TRACK YOU OR TO SELL TO THIRD-PARTIES. IT WILL ONLY BE USED TO FACILITATE THE SEARCH AND PAYMENT FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SITE. HOWEVER, IF YOU VIOLATE GROUPET’S TERMS OF SERVICE, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY OF YOUR INFORMATION WHEN CONTACTING THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY. </p>
      <h4>Log Data</h4>
      <p class="about-content">When you visit the Site, whether as a User or a non-registered user, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site and Application's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site to our visitors' and client’s needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we or third-parties may aggregate, analyze and evaluate Non-Identifying Information and Log Data information for the same purposes as stated above. </p>

Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by GroupEt Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and then close your browser. Third-party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionality of the Site.</p>
      <h4>Phishing</h4>
      <p class="about-content">Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to GroupEt.

We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your GroupEt Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.
